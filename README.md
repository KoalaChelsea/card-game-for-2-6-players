# card-game-for-2-6-players
The game consists of one or more rounds where each player plays one card. Each round also has a lead suit (card symbol). The winner of the round is the player with the highest rank (card number) in the same suit as the lead suit. Note that rank 1 (A) is the highest rank. The winner of the round receives one point for each card in the round that matches the lead suit. For example, if the lead suit is clubs, and the four players play 7 of clubs, 9 of diamonds, 6 of hearts, and 3 of clubs, the winning card is 7 of clubs and the player receives 2 points. After all the rounds, the player with the most total points wins.
